# WOD-Mortal-charsheet

It is the first character sheet, created for http://charsheet.su .
It is based on Mr Gone's character sheets (http://mrgone.rocksolidshells.com/) so credit for design goes to him.

What I used for this character sheet:

JQuery
Bootstrap 3
X-editable https://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/
Jquery bar rating http://antenna.io/demo/jquery-bar-rating/examples/

You are free to fork this repository, make pull requests and make new character sheets.

FAQ:
Q: Why do you use images instead of backgrounds?
A: Because otherwise browsers don't allow to print background.
